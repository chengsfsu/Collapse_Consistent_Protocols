# Collapse_Consistent_Protocols
This Matlab code implements the developed collapse-consistent protocols for experimental testing of steel columns under cyclic loading. The Figure.jpg file shall be in the same folder with the Collapse_protocol_Final.m file that essentially produces the loading protocol for the steel column of interest. 

The protocols are developed based on work done by Suzuki and Lignos (2018). The following two references may be used if the developed code is employed:

Suzuki, Y., Lignos, D.G. (2018). "Development of Collapse-Concistent Loading Protocols for Experimental Testing of Steel Columns", Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics (EESD), (under review)

Suzuki, Y., Lignos, D.G. (2018). "Earthquake-induced Collapse of Steel Moment Resisting Frames with Conventional and High-Performance Steel Columns", Report No. 257581, Resilient Steel Structures Laboratory, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), publisher, McGill University.

General Instructions:

The loading protocols can be developed based on the general guidelines discussed in Chapter 4 of the Suzuki (2018) PhD dissertation as well as the Suzuki and Lignos (2018) article. A user has the capability to develop such protocols either based on user-defined input parameters that are usually based on individual monotonic test data or by automated empirical formulas that define a steel column's deteriorating characteristics if its geometric and material properties are known. The axial load variation for end columns is also defined in a similar manner.
